ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Calvin Tai. 
My research bridges machine learning and human-computer interaction to enhance the accessibility and interpretability of AI. 
I design and develop novel visual explanations and interactive interfaces for complex AI models, 
enabling users to easily understand how AI model works and what they have learned.
